# Q1
first = 7
second = 44.3
print(first + second)
print(first * second)
print(first / second)
print('yes')
# Q2
# The values would be:
# a = 9
# b = 8
# c = 15

# Q3
# There's no significant difference, both options represent type class string

# Q4
my_number = 5 + 5
print(f"result: {my_number}")

# Q5
# the output will be 7, because int will round 2.36 into 2 and add 5

# Q6
a = 8
b = "123"

print(a + int(b))
